## 🛠️ Project Overview

This portfolio was designed and developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with the help of **Cursor AI** for initial scaffolding and refactoring.  
Later, I made custom modifications to personalize the design and content according to my preferences.

## ⚙️ Development Process

### 1. **HTML Structure**
- Created the base layout with sections like **Home**, **About**, **Skills**, **Projects**, and **Contact**.  
- Added semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO.  
- Embedded navigation links for smooth scrolling between sections.

### 2. **CSS Styling**
- Designed a clean and modern responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **Grid**.  
- Applied custom color schemes, hover effects, and animations.  
- Styled the navigation bar, project cards, and footer for consistency across devices.

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**
- Implemented smooth scroll and interactive animations.  
- Added form validation for the **Contact** section.  
- Managed theme effects and minor DOM interactions for a dynamic user experience.

## 🧩 Custom Modifications

After generating the base structure with Cursor AI, I made several custom updates:
- Changed **contact details** (phone number, email address).  
- Updated **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profile links.  
- Customized the **Skills Section** with my own technologies.  
- Attached my **personal photo** to the “About Me” section.  
- Modified a few content blocks and styles to match my desired look.
